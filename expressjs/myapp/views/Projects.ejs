            <h2>Final Project (Introduction to Programming for IT)</h2>
            <p>Created a project that develops a student ledger and displays details about the students. The program
                allows the admin to save the entered details: Yes/No. If ‘Yes', it allows the admin to
                add more students: Yes/No. If 'No', it displays all the entered student details in the form
                of a table where the first column is “Student Number”, the second column is “First Name”
                and so on. From here, the admin is allowed to go to the main menu and exit the program.</p>

            <h2>Final Project (Object-Oriented Programming)</h2>
            <p>I needed to develop a game that converted normal English words into secret codes. In order to convert, the program
                randomly applied an encryption algorithm to any given message. The algorithms I
                needed to implement included Substitution, Playfair, Caesar, Transposition, Product,
                and RSA ciphers.</p>
            <p>-</p>
            <h2>Final Network Design (Introduction to Networks)</h2>
            <p>With a given network topology, we were to create subnets and addresses for various devices (routers,
                switches, endpoint devices) within Local Area Networks that conjoined into one Wide Area Network and made sure that they were all able to ping each other. If not,
                then were to troubleshoot each device and its configuration to verify and update
                its configuration in order for certain devices to communicate with one another.</p>
            <p>-</p>
            <h2>Practical Case Study (Introduction to Networking II)</h2>
            <p>My task was to develop a pilot network capable of being integrated such that all branches will be connected
                through a dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) connection using Border Gateway
                Protocol (BGP) and can be managed completely remotely from the Ontario Tech
                Residence.</p>
